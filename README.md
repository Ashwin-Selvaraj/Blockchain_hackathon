# **Decentralized Lending and Borrowing Platform**

**Objectives**
A decentralized lending and borrowing platform where users can able to lend money to the liquidity pool and also users can able to borrow money from the pool to a certain limit. The main objective of this platform is to provide more rewards to the users.

**Problem it solves**
•	Now-a-days people face difficulty for getting loans from banks and the interest rate was also quite high and when they try to lend money to the bank, they are not getting enough interest from their money since banks are taking commission from people’s interest.
•	This problem of high interest for borrowers and low rewards for lenders, can be eliminated with the help of Decentralized Lending and Borrowing platform which functions similar to that of a bank but its fully automated and code driven.
